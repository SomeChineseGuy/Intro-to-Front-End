            Do you see any Teletubbies in here? Do you see a slender plastic
            tag clipped to my shirt with my name printed on it? Do you see a
            little Asian child with a blank expression on his face sitting
            outside on a mechanical helicopter that shakes when you put quarters
            in it? No? Well, that's what you see at a toy store. And you must think
            you're in a toy store, because you're here shopping for an infant named
            Jeb.
