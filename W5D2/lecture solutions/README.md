## jQuery
- is something we use to handle events
- basically lets us manipulate

## JSON
- JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation and it's a popular
way to share information between computers over the internet.
- Think about a pizza box from a restaurant, it will be hard work
if we have to learn how to unbox pizza anytime we order from a different
restaurant. Standardization brings sanity; this is one of the whys for JSON.
- What's more, JSON at its core is the familiar JavaScript objects and arrays,
just wrapped up in a big string to make it easy to transport across the
internet. Unboxing that string (like a delivered pizza) into real usable data
is a simple JSON.parse(data).

## Advance jQuery!
- Last time we learned how to edit the CSS now lets learn how to edit the HTML
- .prepend = add something before
- .append = add something after
- .before = add something before the element
- .after = add something after the element
